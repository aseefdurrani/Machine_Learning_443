# Machine Learning Class Repository

This is a repository dedicated to my Machine Learning class. In this repository, you will find all the code that I used to complete my assignments for this course.

Feel free to explore the different folders and files, which represent my work on various topics and exercises covered throughout the class.

## Structure

- Each assignment is organized by folders.
- README files or comments are included in each assignment folder to explain the problem, methodology, and results.

Thank you for visiting!
